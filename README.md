# Hi there 👋
## My name is Noah!

- 🚶 I’m currently working on changing career fields from ***Chemical Engineering*** to the Tech field (***Software Engineering and Development***)!
- 🧐 I’m currently learning backend web development (Python, API, Django, etc.). I am taking the Meta Backend Developer certification course. I plan to learn more *Data Analytics* + *Advanced Python ML & AI* after building a better foundation in the Meta course! **Any advice and help is welcome!**
- 📚 Most of my coding experience is in VBA, Python, Flutter/Dart. I used VBA mainly for college and learned python on my own. I used flutter to build a cross-platform application from scratch my senior year while working at an engineering compnay. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning how to collaborate using GitHub. I programmed with others in school but we met in person and used onedrive on a good day (otherwise we had indavidual files and collaborated in person when merging 😬). I also learned SQL while working as a process engineer and I really enjoyed **[The SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com)** while learning (Super fun)!
- 💬 Ask me about my interest in programming and development!
- #📫 Reach out on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-grayhek/) I would love to connect!
